I've really started to think about personal finance in 2016. That's when I stumbled upon [MMM][mmm], aka Mr. Money Mustache. I cannot recall where exactly I found the reference to his website, I guess some news article about the FIRE movement. I was skeptical at first, FIRE was not widely spread or known in Europe or even Czech Republic. Also, the whole idea itself sounded odd. I was expecting popup windows for seminars, investing books with guaranteed tips on how to beat the market etc. Boy how I was wrong. 

I read a few posts and soon got hooked thanks to the writing style of the author and the strong focus on not only earning money, but also and maybe foremost stressing to curb your spending. Or more precisely spending on the things you value most. Having enough. Not needing fancy car even if you could afford it etc. Preventing all the "I deserve this" and "The others have it, so I want it too". All the other personal finance sites I've seen usually go the way of "earn more and more, side hustle all the time, work your ass off". 

The overreach to healthy living was nice as well -- biking, eating healthy, lifting weights. I still have way to ge here, but I'm working on it.
