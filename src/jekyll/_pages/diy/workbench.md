A long, long time ago, I discovered [Lost Art Press][lost-art-press]. And then I read [The Anarchist’s Workbench][anarchists-workbench] and while reading, I thought -- wait a second, I recognize this writing style. And how could I not when the book was written by the very same Christopher Schwarz.

The book inspired me to try and build my own. It turned out great, 5 years and counting and. It's built from ordinary spruce beams (10x10 cm) and some planks (8x4 cm or so) which I got from my parents. They have forest, full of spruce and pine (as very common in Czechia) and since me and my siblings help them out to clean and harvest the forrest, we get free wood, both for building and fire.  

Day and night compared to my old "workbench" -- [Pracovní stůl Hecht][stul-hecht] (imagine-puking-emoji-here). I has to make it heavier by putting s slab of cncrete on the bottom of it, so that it does not move every time I try to plane something on it. At the end, I successfully converted it to a stand, bolting my heavy my table thickener to it (Metabo DH 330). So it became useful after all, but not for much else than this :-)
