Learning some basic plumbing stuff was also good experience which paid for itself already. How to join copper fittings with threading, how to weld PPR together, how to format and use bellows ("vlnovec" in Czech), that was all very useful. The first several seals we made with my dad the old-fashioned way (using hemp & paste), when installing a central water-softener for the house, were all leaking first, a lot. It was a stressful afternoon with when your wife is asking when the water will be running again in the house :-) But I watched some videos overnight, learned about [Tangit sealing cord][tangit] and teflon tapes and voil√†, the next day we fixed everything and worked without a single drop from the joins.
