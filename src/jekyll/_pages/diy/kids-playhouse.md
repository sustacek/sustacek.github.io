A kids playhouse is a classic for all small kids. Some place to hide away and consider your own mini-home. I did not like any of the store-bought ones which you could I could find at the time

This was actually my first big project, if I can recall. I did not know almost anything a t the beginning, had almost no tools (definitely no power tools). So it took forever to build (a year or so, of casually contributing here and there when I had the time and the weather was nice). I learned a ton, and bought a ton - of tools :-)

The kids playhouse is getting old now, and they definitely are outgrowing it (time flies). So I'm already planning to build a bigger one, where they could hang out, read, meet with friends etc.
