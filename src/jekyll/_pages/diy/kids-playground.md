In the summer of 2019, I had some time off and decided to complete a thing I wanted to build for a long time -- some swings and monkey bars outside in the garden, for kids to play and practice their climbing skills. I looked like they'd build a public playground in our village, so I was hesitant to start, but 5 years and counting and no puolic one is still finished, so I'm glad I built our own private one. It was priceless as the covid years were about to hit and we spent a lot of time at home / in the garden.
