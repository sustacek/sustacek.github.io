My main profession is software development. I like writing clean code, which is easy to read and maintain. I am based in the Czech Republic and available for remote engagements. I worked fully remotely for the past 12 years and found this to be the most efficient way of getting the job done.

I have an excellent handle on English, both written and spoken, gained thanks to college education and living 4 years in the USA. While living in the land of the free and the home of the brave, I was working full time for Liferay GS in Chicago and continued to work remotely from the Czech Republic for the next 8+ years. .
