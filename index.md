Hi, welcome to my site! My name is Josef Šustáček and I am an independent Java and Liferay Developer who loves to create quatlity code and provide realible, well tested and documented solutions. I have over 15 years of software development experience and consulting.  

I am an ex-Liferay Global services consultant with experinece in Liferay platform spanning versions 5.2.1 up to the latest DXP 7.4 / quarterly releases. I did an extensive work in AWS cloud as well, creating a complete development and runtime ecosystem for Liferay DXP, including developer exeprience using Liferay Workspace, CI/CD using Jenkins and EC2 as the runtime.

If you want to find out more about my experience, see the [About][about] page.

Aside from software development, I really like working with wood and fixing things -- giving them a new life and preventing their (wasteful) disposal. You can find out more in [Woodworking][woodworking]. I also enjoy personal finance and investing, more on that in [Personal Finance][personal-finance].

When not building of fixing stuff, I like playing volleyball and beachvolleyball, mountain biking in the countryside and spending time with our kids. I started to do climbing / bouldering thanks to my kids, but I have a long way to go to catch up to their idol -- [Adam Ondra][adam-ondra] :-) I picked up playing ukulele few years back and hope to learn basics of acoustic guitar as well.
